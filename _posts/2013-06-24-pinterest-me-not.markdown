## Tired of this guy?

Install this extension!
[Available in the Chrome Web Store](http://goo.gl/BYus5).

*Pinterest-me-not* does one thing and does it well: it removes the
giant yellow nag box from Pinterest for non-logged-in users.

This isn't my first Chrome extension but it's the first one I've
published to the Chrome Web Store. It's dead simple (just over 20
lines of code) and is
[available on Github](https://github.com/mgalgs/pinterest-me-not). If
you're interested in learning how to write Chrome extensions it's
about as simple of an example as you can get (it just hides one
element on a page using jquery).

Of course, Google also has a great set of
[documentation](http://developer.chrome.com/extensions/) and
[tutorials](http://developer.chrome.com/extensions/tutorials.html) to
get started with Chrome extension development... It's really easy!
Seriously! (Especially if you've done web development in the past).
