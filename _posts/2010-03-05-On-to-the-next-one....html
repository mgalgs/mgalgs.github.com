Well, everything went well with my senior project (except it never did get off the ground). It was still an awesome learning experience. If only I had bought bigger motors...<br /><br />I've recently taken a job working with <a href="http://www.neng.usu.edu/ece/faculty/winstead/">Dr. Winstead</a> in the ECE department at USU. I'm working on a system that detects when horses are distressed so they can get help before they die. You can read more on the project <a href="http://www.neng.usu.edu/ece/faculty/winstead/research/research_projects/equine_distress_monitor.html">here</a>. The system is based on an AVR+ZigBee module, which is SWEET! So basically I get to play around with electronics and microcontrollers and get paid for it. I'm living the life :-)<br /><br />One thing I've been able to learn at this new job is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printed_circuit_board">PCB</a> design. Below is a picture of my first PCB:<br /><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_ERTez3oxg2I/S4xH9dE5fJI/AAAAAAAAARw/4f0SOI4kMfI/s1600/2010-02-26%2016.17.44.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_ERTez3oxg2I/S4xH9dE5fJI/AAAAAAAAARw/4f0SOI4kMfI/s320/2010-02-26%2016.17.44.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />In other news, I'm going to <a href="http://www.ucr.edu/">UC Riverside</a> for grad school! I got a 1 year fellowship+stipend in the Electrical Engineering Department. They're also flying me out next week to attend an Open House. Pizza! Sonnie and I are going to Brazil the day after I get home. By the end of Spring Break I will have flown 6 times (not counting layovers). Castaway time!<br /><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_ERTez3oxg2I/S5CJUBhLXkI/AAAAAAAAASo/OS4gRn6OOWU/s1600/river_highlanders_logo.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_ERTez3oxg2I/S5CJUBhLXkI/AAAAAAAAASo/OS4gRn6OOWU/s320/river_highlanders_logo.png" /></a></div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8243365953452498700-4478148658512979677?l=mgalgs.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
