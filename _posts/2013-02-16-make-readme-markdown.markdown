`make-readme-markdown.el` is an
[Emacs script](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Initial-Options.html#Initial-Options)
(i.e. invoked with `--script`) that can be used to convert typical
Elisp file comment headers into `README.md` files, suitable for usage
on GitHub, etc.

The `README.md` on the `make-readme-markdown` project itself is
"self-hosted" (i.e. the README on the GitHub page for the script is
generated by the script itself by parsing itself (holy META!)) :). So
it's a good example to look at if you're curious about how this thing
works.
